## Overview
myNode aims to be the easiest way to run a dedicated, easy to use, Bitcoin Full Node and Lightning Wallet! By combining the best open source software with our UI, management, and monitoring software, you can easily, safely, and securely use Bitcoin and Lightning.

myNode is a software that integrates a number of Bitcoin related open source projects and provides access to the Bitcoin and Lightning networks along with a number of other features! By using a dedicated device, like myNode 1, you get uptime, reliability, and ease-of-use that other software-only solutions cannot provide.

By running a Bitcoin Full node and Lightning on your myNode device, you maintain all the security and advantages originally intended in the Bitcoin protocol. Information about your Bitcoin addresses and spending is verified by your local node and removes the need to trust online 3rd parties for getting information about your funds.
